## Abstract
Total value locked (TVL) and DEX volume are popular metrics for judging the success of blockchains and projects in the crypto industry. The aim of this proposal is to increase these metrics for Algorand. This will be achieved by strategic capital deployment of entropy tokenization assets and targeted trading activity based on AI.

## Team
ShaperOfEntropy (<a href="https://twitter.com/EntropyShaper" target="_blank">@EntropyShaper</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ShaperOfEntropy" target="_blank">u/ShaperOfEntropy</a>) - Project Lead

## Experience with Algorand
ShaperOfEntropy has been a member of Algorand community since its early days, particularly passionate about its decentralization and governance.

- Ran a successful <a href="https://twitter.com/EntropyShaper/status/1531174016815357952" target="_blank">campaign</a> to increase Algorand's TVL on Tinyman for more than 20M USD in a matter of days (from 29.05.2022 to 01.06.2022), <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/tinyman" target="_blank">according to DefiLlama</a>
- Engaged in discussions regarding Algorand Governance and xGov across various platforms
- Running multiple participation nodes
- Supporting Algorand projects, e.g. Folks Finance by participating and winning in their <a href="https://github.com/ShaperOfEntropy/improving-UI-UX-on-Folks-Finance" target="_blank">UX improvement bounty</a>, which <a href="https://twitter.com/FolksFinance/status/1737489376446206176" target="_blank">were recently implemented</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/852212243596050433/852224744178581525/992415013639835779" target="_blank">suggesting to split the votes</a> in Governance according to the users votes, which was also later implemented; or Pact by uncovering the <a href="https://twitter.com/d13_co/status/1696103414743101452" target="_blank">manipulation</a> of a large giveaway by their community manager

## Present Proposal
The proposal will build upon the success of the <a href="https://twitter.com/EntropyShaper/status/1531174016815357952" target="_blank">campaign from 2022</a>. It will introduce multiple regulated liquidity pools of purposefully-designed entropy tokenization assets. The funds will be used to slowly increase the liquidity over a timescale of multiple weeks and to cover transaction fees for simultaneous ramping up of trading activity. The trading will be performed according to a specially-built AI algorithm, which combines entropy prediction models on a global scale with natural language processing model like the GPT. The trading will be performed on DEX with the lowest TVL to help equalize distribution of Targeted DeFi Rewards.

## Future Blueprint
If the proposal with its test passes successfully, its continuation will be considered until the xGov program matures.

## Benefits for the community
The proposal will increase Algorand's TVL and DEX volume. It is estimated the metrics will be increased at least by factor 2 and 5, respectively. This will move Algorand on <a href="https://defillama.com/chains" target="_blank">DeFiLlama's list</a> multiple spots higher. The proposal will also showcase the suitability of TVL and DEX volume metrics for judging a project. The trading activity will contribute to Algorand's fee sink and TPS.
